# MNIST_DataSet
  This project serves as an introduction to Deep Learning using [Keras](https://keras.io/), within which one can train a neural network-based image classifier
to identify images within the [MNIST Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). To keep things simple, this neural network 
employs only two hidden Dense layers. 

An similar example exists on [Keras](https://keras.io/examples/mnist_cnn/).

To use it, simply import the required packages, all of which should be in Keras, and run it.
